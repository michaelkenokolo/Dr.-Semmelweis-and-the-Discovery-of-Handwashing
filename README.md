# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician at the Vienna General Hospital who discovered the importance of handwashing in the early 19th century. What led to his discovery was his desire to find a cure for childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting women that had just given birth. In the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital, as many as 10% of the women giving birth died from it. This project reanalyzes the data that led to Semmelweis's discovery of handwashing, and how So handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval.
